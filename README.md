# UE5 Tool for materials workflow

## Tool Summary

This tool is designed to streamline the process of texture mapping and 
material creation in Unreal Engine 5. It automates the task of associating 
texture maps with meshes, creating and applying materials to the 
corresponding meshes. It works in correlation with the Houdini batch export tool.

## Note

This tool was solely written for specific uses within a personal project 
and is nowhere near a finished piece of work. The aim was to produce a 
quick script to automate a repetitive task. It is not designed to be 
robust nor is it ready to be integrated into other people's workflows, 
unless further changes are made in the code. In the future, I will add 
error checking and testing to make it more reliable, and also potentially 
a UI to make it artist friendly. But the main logic is there :)

## I will add more details soon
